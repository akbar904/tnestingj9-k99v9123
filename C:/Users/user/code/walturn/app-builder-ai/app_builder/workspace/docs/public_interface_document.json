{"package_name":"com.walturn.flutter_app","project_description":"A simple Flutter application demonstrating the Cubit pattern for state management. The app features a single screen that displays a text with an icon. When the text is clicked, it toggles between a text of 'Cat' with a clock icon and a text of 'Dog' with a person icon.","architecture_overview":"The project follows a highly modularized architecture with a clear separation of concerns. It employs the Cubit pattern for state management, ensuring a predictable flow of state changes. The project is organized into distinct folders for screens, cubits, models, and widgets.","folder_structure":{"lib":{"main.dart":"","screens":{"home_screen.dart":""},"cubits":{"home_cubit.dart":""},"models":{"home_state.dart":""},"widgets":{"custom_text_widget.dart":""}}},"files":[{"name":"lib/main.dart","description":"Entry point of the application.
